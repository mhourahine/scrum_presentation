##Case Study - FBI SENTINEL PROJECT

###Executive Summary:

Virtual Case File (or VCF) was a software application developed by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) between 2000 and 2005. The project was not close to completion when it was officially abandoned in January 2005, having turned into a complete fiasco for the FBI. In addition to wasting at least US $100 million, the failure brought widespread criticism to the bureau and its director, Robert S. Mueller III.

###Key Takeaways:

- $575 million dollars wasted on the first two attempts at the project
- Scrum Studio was set up in the basement of the Hoover Building
- Staff reduced from 400 to 40, and in 1 year and $30 million, they were code complete, at a cost savings of more than 90 percent
